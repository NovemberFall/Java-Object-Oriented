## Overview

- Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods, or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively. 
- Generics also provide **compile-time type safety** that allows programmers to **catch invalid types** at compile time. This reference will take you through simple and practical methods using Java Generics.
